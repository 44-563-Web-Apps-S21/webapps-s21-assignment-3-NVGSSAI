            <b>Gardening makes me feel cool and peacefull</b>.it boosts my energy.<br>
             it gives me real joy and satisfaction of the heart and mind.<br> 
            <b>Gardening takes me close to Nature, to the plants, trees and earth,<br> 
             and I feel the freshness of things.</b> While working in my garden,<br>
             I see beautiful birds and hear their sweet chirping.
             For some time,<br> I forget all the worries or problems of life.
             I am in a world much higher than the ordinary one of “duties and desires.”
